# Changelog

## Version 1.0.3

The modelclasses submodule was previously only importedwithin the module when utitilies.TestPackage() was called. This lead to the submodule only being accessible by a user after calling TestPackage(). No the submodule is accessable imediately after importing.

Fixed mathstrings for user defined functions and reaction not being properly converted to use Python functions.

When generating the method to solve for a reaction's velocity, the code will now check if an id refers to a reaction parameter before checking global model parameters.
